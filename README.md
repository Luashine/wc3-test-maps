# Test maps for Warcraft 3

I will use this repository to create small test maps for various pieces of Warcraft 3. I'll mostly use it for working on the jassdoc:

1. Jassdoc by lep: https://github.com/lep/jassdoc/
2. Jassdoc by moyack: https://wc3modding.info/pages/jass-documentation-database/

## AddResourceAmount 

(Jass, 1.27)

Creates multiple mines to test Add/Set|ResourceAmount functions. Includes: 0, set negative, add big negative.
